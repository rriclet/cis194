# cis194 homework 

## Setup

My homework following [CIS194 : Introduction to Haskell](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~cis194/spring13/)  

This project is using `stack` and `hspec`.  

To get this project running, [install stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/)  

Pull the project, `stack test` to run unit tests

## Other

Homework 7 is not included because I could not get the given helper `.hs` files to compile.
